 These playbooks are provided to sping a quick demo environment up in Azure or AWS.

 If you have ansible installed, you can run the playbooks with:

 ansible-playbook <playbook name>

 e.g. 

 ansible-playbook CREATE-azure-arm-ha-api-exist-payg-UDR.yaml


There are instructions contained within each playbook, and within the vars files.  The instructions in the playbook tell you how to declare your credentials.

Do not put them in any file of folder contained in this repo.
